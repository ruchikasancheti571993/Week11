#Recommendation System using AI/HCI Project
Recommendation systems have become essential in modern applications, enabling personalized suggestions across e-commerce, streaming, and other online services. In this project, we developed a book recommendation system utilizing collaborative filtering. By analyzing user ratings and preferences, we aim to recommend books to users based on the reading habits of other users with similar tastes.
